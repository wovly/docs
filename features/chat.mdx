## Natural Language Commands

Talk to Wovly like you would a human assistant:

```
"Email Jeff about the project deadline"

"What's on my calendar tomorrow?"

"Text Sarah that I'm running 10 minutes late"

"Find the cheapest flights to London next month"

"Summarize my unread emails"
```

## Message Approval

Before sending any message, Wovly will ask for your approval:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/message-confirmation.png" alt="Message confirmation dialog" />
</Frame>

You can:
- **Approve** to send as-is
- **Edit** to modify the message
- **Cancel** to abort

<Note>
  This safety feature ensures you always review messages before they're sent. Auto-send can be enabled for Tasks in Settings (coming soon).
</Note>

## Conversation Context

Wovly remembers your conversation within a session:

```
You: "Email Jeff about the meeting"
Wovly: "I'll draft an email to Jeff about the meeting..."

You: "Add Sarah to the CC"  
Wovly: [Knows you mean the email to Jeff, adds Sarah to CC]
```

## Getting Help

Ask Wovly about its features:

```
"What can you do?"

"How do I create a skill?"

"Explain how tasks work"
```

Wovly has built-in knowledge of its features and can fetch detailed documentation when needed.

## Tips

<Tip>
  **Be specific** - "Email Jeff about rescheduling our Tuesday meeting to Wednesday" works better than "Email Jeff"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use context** - If you just discussed something, reference it: "Send that to Sarah too"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Create Tasks** - For multi-step processes or follow-ups, let Wovly create a Task to handle it autonomously
</Tip>
