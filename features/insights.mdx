## Overview

Wovly's Smart Insights automatically analyzes your messages across all connected platforms (Gmail, Slack, iMessage, custom websites, etc.) to surface important information you might have missed. Every hour, the system cross-references new messages with your profile, goals, calendar, and historical context to generate actionable insights.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message Collection (Every Hour)">
    Collect new messages from Gmail, Slack, iMessage, custom websites, and more
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fact Extraction">
    AI extracts key facts: people, dates, commitments, questions, sentiment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cross-Referencing">
    Compare facts against your profile, calendar, goals, and conversation history
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insight Generation">
    When conflicts, gaps, or patterns detected → generate insight
  </Step>
  <Step title="Priority Scoring (1-5)">
    Score based on urgency, sender importance, time sensitivity, keywords
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Filtering">
    Show only high-value insights aligned with your goals
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
You'll typically see **3-10 insights per day** instead of hundreds of messages.

## Insight Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Conflict Detection" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Identifies scheduling conflicts, contradictory information, overlapping commitments

    **Example:** "You have two meetings scheduled at 2pm on Friday"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Follow-up Tracking" icon="reply">

</CardGroup>

## Priority Scoring

Each insight receives a priority score from 1-5:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Priority 5 (Critical)" icon="5">
    - Urgent conflicts or missed deadlines
    - Important unanswered questions
    - Scheduling conflicts
    - Pending responses from VIPs

    **Action:** Address immediately
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 4 (High)" icon="4">
    - Scheduling conflicts
    - Pending responses from VIPs
    - Important but not urgent items

    **Action:** Address today
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 3 (Medium)" icon="3">
    - General follow-ups
    - Minor conflicts
    - Background information

    **Action:** Review when convenient
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 2 (Low)" icon="2">

    - Nice-to-know information

    **Action:** Optional review
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 1 (Minimal)" icon="1">

    **Action:** Usually auto-filtered
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Determines Priority?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Sender Importance" icon="user-crown">
    Based on your interaction history and VIP list
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Sensitivity" icon="clock">
    Deadlines, meeting proximity, urgency keywords
  </Card>
  <Card title="Goal Alignment" icon="bullseye">
    Relevance to your stated goals and preferences
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration Source Icons

Each insight card displays an icon showing the primary platform:

- 📧 **Gmail** - Email-based insights
- 💬 **iMessage** - Text message insights
- 💼 **Slack** - Workspace communication
- 🌐 **Custom Website** - Scraped messages
- 📅 **Calendar** - Event-based insights

The icon represents the **most common source** among related messages for that insight.

## Using Insights Effectively

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Daily Review">
    **Morning routine:**
    - Review insights from overnight
    - Identify urgent action items
    - Plan your day around priorities
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Take Action">
    **From insight card:**
    - **Respond** - Reply directly
    - **Schedule** - Add to calendar
    - **Dismiss** - Mark as handled
    - **Snooze** - Remind me later
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Customize">
    **Settings → Insights:**
    - Filter by priority (only 3+)
    - Filter by source platform
    - Adjust check frequency
    - Define focus areas
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-Source Analysis

Insights can combine information from multiple platforms:

<CodeGroup>

```text Example Scenario
1. Client sends email asking for meeting
2. Colleague messages on Slack about client prep
3. Calendar shows conflict at requested time
4. Daycare sends message about early pickup needed

Generated insight (Priority 5):
"Client meeting conflicts with existing event.
Early daycare pickup at 4pm limits afternoon.
Colleague waiting for prep discussion."

Suggested action: Propose alternative time,
coordinate with colleague, arrange daycare backup.
```

</CodeGroup>

This holistic view saves you from context-switching across apps.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No insights showing">
    **Possible causes:**
    - No new messages in the past hour
    - All insights below priority filter
    - Integration not configured

    **Solutions:**
    - Check Settings → Integrations
    - Lower priority filter threshold
    - Manually trigger refresh
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many insights">
    **Solutions:**
    - Increase priority threshold to 3 or 4
    - Add more specific goals
    - Configure per-platform filters
    - Exclude low-value channels
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insights seem inaccurate">
    **Solutions:**
    - Update profile in Settings → About Me
    - Connect Google Calendar
    - Give system 2-3 days to build context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```text Example 1: Cross-Platform Coordination
Messages:
- Gmail: Client asks for Friday 2pm meeting
- Slack: Colleague asks when client meeting is
- iMessage: Wife asks to pick up kids at 2pm Friday
- Calendar: Team sync already at 2pm Friday

Generated Insight (Priority 5):
"Four conflicting commitments at 2pm Friday.
Client meeting (email), team sync (calendar),
child pickup (text), colleague inquiry (Slack)
all need coordination."
```

```text Example 2: Follow-up Detection
Messages:
- Slack (Monday): Boss asks for Q1 numbers
- Gmail (Wednesday): Boss follows up on Q1 numbers
- No response sent

Generated Insight (Priority 4):
"Boss has asked twice for Q1 numbers
(Slack Mon, Email Wed) with no response yet.
Deadline may be approaching."
```

```text Example 3: Custom Website Integration
Messages:
- Brightwheel: Field trip form due Friday
- Calendar: Out of office all day Friday
- Gmail: No communication with teacher

Generated Insight (Priority 3):
"Daycare field trip form due Friday,
but you're OOO that day.
Submit early or email teacher about extension."
```
