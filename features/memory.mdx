# Memory & Profile

Wovly maintains memory of your conversations and learns about you over time. This context makes interactions more personalized and efficient.

## User Profile

Your profile provides context for every interaction. Set it up in the **About Me** page:

- **Name**: How Wovly addresses you
- **Occupation**: Helps with professional context
- **City**: For weather, local searches
- **Home Life**: Family, pets, routines

## Conversation Memory

### Daily Logs

Wovly saves daily conversation summaries to:
```
~/.wovly-assistant/memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

These include:
- Key topics discussed
- Decisions made
- Action items
- Important facts learned

### Long-term Memory

Periodically, daily logs are summarized into long-term memory:
```
~/.wovly-assistant/memory/longterm/
```

This enables Wovly to recall conversations from weeks or months ago.

## Using Memory

### Automatic Context

Wovly automatically uses memory in conversations:

```
You: What did we decide about the vacation?

Wovly: [Searches memory]
       Last week you decided on the Hawaii trip for March 15-22.
       You were going to book the hotel this week.
```

### Explicit Search

Ask Wovly to search past conversations:

```
You: Did we ever discuss the marketing budget?

Wovly: [Searches memory]
       Yes, on January 15th you mentioned setting aside $5,000 
       for Q1 marketing. On January 20th you revised it to $7,500.
```

## Profile Updates

Wovly can learn facts about you from conversation:

```
You: My daughter's birthday is April 3rd

Wovly: Got it! I'll remember that your daughter's birthday is April 3rd.
       Would you like me to save this to your profile?
```

## Privacy

<Note>
  All memory data is stored locally on your machine. Nothing is sent to external servers except the LLM API calls needed for conversation.
</Note>

### Data Locations

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Profile | `~/.wovly-assistant/settings.json` |
