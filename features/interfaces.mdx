## Remote Access Architecture

All interfaces connect to the same Wovly desktop instance:

<Frame>
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Wovly Desktop] --> B[Context Manager]
    A --> C[Tool Executor]
    A --> D[Interface Handlers]
    D --> E[Desktop UI]
    D --> F[WhatsApp API]
    D --> G[Telegram API]
    D --> H[Discord API]
    B --> I[Profile & Memory]
    C --> J[Gmail, Slack, iMessage]
```
</Frame>

<Info>
**Key Points:**
- Shared context - all interfaces see same memory
- Same tools - all have access to integrations
- Synchronized - actions reflect everywhere
- Desktop required - remote needs app running
</Info>
