# Voice Mimic

Wovly learns your communication style for each person you message. When drafting messages, it matches your tone, formality, and patterns so responses sound authentically like you.

## How It Works

When you ask Wovly to message someone:

1. **Analyze History** - Wovly reads your past messages to that person
2. **Extract Style** - Identifies patterns in tone, length, greetings, sign-offs
3. **Generate Style Guide** - Creates a persona for messaging that contact
4. **Apply to Draft** - Uses the style guide when composing messages

## Style Elements

Wovly learns:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Formality** | Casual ("hey!") vs Professional ("Dear John,") |
| **Length** | Short texts vs detailed emails |
| **Greetings** | "Hi", "Hey", "Dear", none |
| **Sign-offs** | "Thanks", "Best", "Cheers", "-J" |
| **Emoji usage** | Frequent, occasional, never |
| **Punctuation** | Multiple exclamation marks, periods only |

## Example

### Your past messages to Sarah:
```
hey! r u free for lunch tmrw?
sounds good!! see u at noon :)
haha yes def! cant wait
```

### Wovly's draft style:
```
hey sarah! wanted to check if ur still coming to the party sat?
lmk!! :)
```

### Your past messages to Boss:
```
Hi Michael,

Thank you for the feedback on the Q3 report. I've incorporated 
your suggestions and attached the revised version.

Best regards,
[Name]
```

### Wovly's draft style:
```
Hi Michael,

Following up on our discussion about the marketing budget. 
I've prepared a summary of the proposed changes for your review.

Best regards,
[Name]
```

## Platform Adaptation

Style also adapts to the platform:

- **iMessage/Text**: Shorter, more casual
- **Email**: Longer, more formal
- **Slack**: Medium length, workplace appropriate
- **Discord**: Casual, may include more emoji

## Building Style History

The more you message someone through Wovly (or have message history), the better it mimics your style:

- **New contacts**: Uses your general communication profile
- **Existing contacts**: Learns from message history
- **Frequent contacts**: Highly personalized style

## Overriding Style

You can always guide the style:

```
You: Email Jeff formally about the contract

Wovly: [Uses formal style even if usually casual with Jeff]
```

Or edit the draft:

```
You: Make it more casual

Wovly: [Regenerates with more casual tone]
```

## Privacy

<Note>
  Style analysis happens locally. Your message history is never sent to external servers - only the LLM sees aggregated style patterns during drafting.
