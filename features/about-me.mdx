## Overview

The "About Me" section is the foundation of Wovly's intelligence. Your profile and goals act as the **primary filter** for extracting insights from all your integrations. By understanding who you are, what you're working on, and what matters to you, Wovly can prioritize the right information and ignore the noise.

## How Goals Drive Insights

<Card title="The Insight Filtering Process" icon="filter">
  All Messages (100s/day) → Goal Filter → Relevant Messages (10-20) → Insights (3-10)
</Card>

**Without goals:**
- Generic analysis of all messages
- No context about what's important
- Low-priority items mixed with critical ones
- 50+ insights daily (overwhelming)

**With goals:**
- Focused analysis based on your priorities
- Context-aware prioritization
- Critical items highlighted, noise filtered
- 3-10 actionable insights daily

### Example Scenario

**Your Goal:**
```
Launch Q1 product feature by March 15th
```

**Messages received:**
1. ✅ **Email from engineering:** "API integration blocked" → **Priority 5 insight** (directly related to launch)
2. ✅ **Slack from PM:** "Design review scheduled for Friday" → **Priority 4 insight** (launch prep)
3. ❌ Email from HR: "Update your emergency contact" → **Filtered out** (not related to goal)
4. ❌ Slack in #random: "Who wants lunch?" → **Filtered out** (social, not priority)
5. ✅ **Calendar:** "Product demo meeting conflicts with engineering sync" → **Priority 5 insight** (launch conflict)

**Result:** 3 actionable insights instead of 5 notifications, all focused on your goal.

## Goals as Priority Signals

### How Wovly Uses Goals

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keyword Matching" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Goal mentions "product launch" → messages with launch, release, deploy get higher priority
  </Card>
  <Card title="People Matching" icon="users">
    Goal mentions "Sarah" → messages from Sarah automatically prioritized
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeline Matching" icon="clock">
    Goal deadline approaching → urgency increases automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Topic Clustering" icon="layer-group">
    Related messages grouped → single insight instead of many notifications
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Priority Scoring Logic

Goals directly influence the 1-5 priority scale:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Priority 5 (Critical)" icon="circle-exclamation">
    - Message directly mentions goal keyword + deadline approaching
    - Conflict detected that blocks goal completion
    - VIP (mentioned in goal) sends urgent request
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 4 (High)" icon="circle-arrow-up">
    - Message relates to goal topic
    - Decision point that affects goal timeline
    - Follow-up needed from goal-related contact
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 3 (Medium)" icon="circle-dot">
    - Tangentially related to goal
    - General updates from goal contacts
    - Background information useful for goal
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority 2-1 (Low)" icon="circle">
    - Not related to any active goals
    - Social/informational only
    - Can be safely ignored
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
