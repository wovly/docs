# Skills

Skills are reusable procedures that define how Wovly handles specific types of tasks. Think of them as playbooks - custom workflows tailored to your communication style and needs.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that describe:

- **When** to use the skill (trigger conditions)
- **What** steps to follow
- **How** to communicate in each step
- **Templates** for common messages
