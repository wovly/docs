## Karma Requirements

<Warning>
  New accounts or those with low karma may be restricted from posting in certain subreddits. These are Reddit's rules, not Wovly's.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

Reddit enforces rate limits:
- Posts: ~10 per hour
- Comments: ~10 per minute
- API calls: 60 per minute

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Rate limited">
    Wait a few minutes. Reddit limits how often you can post/comment.
