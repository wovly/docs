# Telegram

Connect Telegram to send messages through a bot and optionally use Telegram as a chat interface to control Wovly.

## Capabilities

### As Integration
- **Send messages** - Send messages through your Telegram bot
- **Get updates** - Receive messages sent to your bot

### As Chat Interface
- **Remote control** - Chat with Wovly via Telegram from your phone
- **Full access** - Same capabilities as desktop chat
- **Mobile notifications** - Get responses on your phone

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Follow prompts to name your bot
4. Copy the **Bot Token** you receive

### Step 2: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on Telegram
3. Paste your Bot Token
4. Click **Connect**

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Click **Test** to verify the bot is working.

## Using as Chat Interface

To use Telegram to chat with Wovly remotely:

1. Go to **Interfaces** in Wovly
2. Find **Telegram** section
3. Click **Connect**
4. Wovly will start listening for messages to your bot

Now you can message your bot on Telegram and Wovly will respond!

```
You (Telegram): What meetings do I have tomorrow?

Wovly (Telegram): You have 2 meetings tomorrow:
- 10:00 AM: Product Review
- 3:00 PM: 1:1 with Manager
```

## Usage as Integration

Use Telegram to send messages to others:

```
"Send a Telegram message to @username about the project"

"Message the team channel on Telegram"
```

<Note>
  Bot-sent messages will appear as from your bot, not your personal account. Recipients need to have started a conversation with your bot.
</Note>

## How It Works

### Integration Mode
Wovly sends messages using the Telegram Bot API.

### Chat Interface Mode
Wovly uses long-polling to check for messages to your bot. When you message the bot, Wovly processes it and replies.

## Security

- Bot token stored locally in `settings.json`
- Messages go through Telegram's servers
- Chat interface can be disabled anytime

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot not responding">
    Ensure the bot token is correct. Try regenerating the token via @BotFather.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't send to user">
    Users must message your bot first to start a conversation. Bots can't initiate DMs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Chat interface not working">
    Check that Telegram is connected in both Integrations AND Interfaces pages.
