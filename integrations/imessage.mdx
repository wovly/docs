# iMessage

Send and read iMessages and SMS directly from Wovly. macOS only.

## Capabilities

- **Send texts** - Send iMessage or SMS to any contact
- **Read messages** - View recent conversations
- **Search history** - Find messages by sender or content
- **Contact lookup** - Find phone numbers from Apple Contacts

## Requirements

- **macOS only** - iMessage integration uses native macOS APIs
- **Full Disk Access** - Required to read message database
- **Contacts access** - Required for contact lookup

## Setup

### Step 1: Enable in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Enable** on iMessage

### Step 2: Grant Full Disk Access

1. Open **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **Privacy**
2. Select **Full Disk Access**
3. Click the lock to make changes
4. Add Wovly to the list

### Step 3: Grant Contacts Access

When prompted, allow Wovly to access your Contacts.

## Usage

```
"Text Sarah happy birthday"

"Send a message to Mom that I'll be late"

"What did John text me today?"

"Search texts for the address Jeff sent"
```

## Contact Resolution

Wovly automatically looks up contacts:

```
You: "Text Sarah about dinner"

Wovly: [Looks up "Sarah" in Contacts]
       [Finds Sarah's phone number]
       [Sends message]
```

If multiple matches:
```
You: "Text John about the meeting"

Wovly: I found multiple Johns:
       - John Smith (work): +1-555-0100
       - John Doe (personal): +1-555-0200
       Which John do you mean?
```

## How It Works

Wovly reads your local Messages database (`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`) and uses AppleScript to send messages through the Messages app.

<Note>
  Messages are sent through Apple's servers just like normal iMessages. Wovly only facilitates sending - your messages aren't processed differently.
</Note>

## Privacy

- Message history is read locally from your Mac
- Sent messages go through Apple's iMessage servers
- No message content is stored by Wovly (except in conversation memory)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't read messages">
    Ensure Full Disk Access is granted. Restart Wovly after granting permission.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Messages not sending">
    Ensure Messages app is set up and you can send messages manually. Wovly uses AppleScript to trigger sends.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contact not found">
    The contact must be in your Apple Contacts app. Check the spelling or add the contact first.
