# X (Twitter)

Connect X (formerly Twitter) to post tweets, send direct messages, and interact with content.

## Capabilities

- **Post tweets** - Share updates to your timeline
- **Send DMs** - Direct message other users
- **Get timeline** - View recent tweets
- **Search** - Find tweets by keyword

## Setup

### Step 1: Apply for Developer Access

1. Go to [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com)
2. Apply for a developer account
3. Create a new project and app

### Step 2: Configure OAuth 2.0

1. In your app settings, enable **OAuth 2.0**
2. Set App Type to **Native App**
3. Add Callback URL: `http://localhost:18923/oauth/callback`

### Step 3: Get Credentials

1. Note your **Client ID**
2. Generate a **Client Secret**

### Step 4: Set Permissions

Required scopes:
- `tweet.read` - Read tweets
- `tweet.write` - Post tweets
- `users.read` - Read user info
- `dm.read` - Read DMs
- `dm.write` - Send DMs

### Step 5: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on X
3. Enter Client ID and Client Secret
4. Click **Connect**
5. Authorize in X

## Usage

```
"Post a tweet: Excited to announce our new feature!"

"DM @username about the collaboration"

"What's trending on X?"

"Search X for posts about AI"
```

## How It Works

Wovly uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, posting as your account (not a bot).

<Warning>
  Tweets and DMs are public actions tied to your account. Always review before posting.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

X has strict API rate limits:
- Tweets: 200 per 15 minutes
- DMs: 1000 per day
- Reads: 100 per 15 minutes

## Troubleshooting

    Wait 15 minutes and try again. Consider reducing automated posting frequency.

  <Accordion title="Can't DM user">
    The user may have DMs disabled or you may not follow each other (depending on their settings).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OAuth error">
    Ensure your app has OAuth 2.0 enabled and the callback URL is exact.
