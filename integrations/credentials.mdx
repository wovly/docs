# Credentials

Store website login credentials securely for automated browser login.

## Why Credentials?

When Wovly uses browser automation to log into websites, it needs your credentials. Instead of asking in chat (insecure), Wovly uses pre-saved credentials that:

- Are stored encrypted locally
- Never appear in chat or logs
- Are auto-filled during browser automation
- Never sent to AI providers

## Setup

1. Go to **Credentials** in Wovly
2. Click **Add Credential**
3. Enter:
   - **Domain**: Website domain (e.g., `amazon.com`)
   - **Username**: Your login username/email
   - **Password**: Your password
4. Click **Save**

## Usage

Once credentials are saved:

```
You: Log into Amazon and check my orders

Wovly: [Navigates to amazon.com]
       [Auto-fills login with saved credentials]
       [Shows your recent orders]
```

## Security

### Encryption

Credentials are encrypted using Electron's safeStorage API, which uses:
- macOS: Keychain
- Windows: DPAPI
- Linux: Secret Service API

### Never Exposed

- Credentials never appear in chat
- Never sent to LLM providers
- Never logged to console or files
- Only used during browser automation

### Local Storage

All credentials stay on your machine:
```
~/.wovly-assistant/settings.json (encrypted)
```

## Managing Credentials

### View Credentials

1. Go to **Credentials** page
2. See list of saved domains
3. Click eye icon to reveal (requires system password)

### Edit Credentials

1. Click on a credential
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update and save

### Delete Credentials

1. Click on a credential
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use app-specific passwords** when available (Google, Apple, etc.) instead of your main password.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Match domain exactly** - Save `accounts.google.com` not just `google.com` for Google login.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Two-factor auth** - Wovly can handle 2FA prompts but may need you to approve on your phone.
</Tip>

    If a site has multiple login pages, you may need credentials for each subdomain.
