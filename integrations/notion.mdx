# Notion

Connect Notion to search pages, create content, and manage your workspace.

## Capabilities

- **Search pages** - Find pages and databases
- **Read content** - Get page contents
- **Create pages** - Add new pages to databases
- **Update pages** - Modify existing content

## Setup

### Step 1: Create Integration

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **New integration**
3. Name it "Wovly"
4. Select your workspace
5. Copy the **Internal Integration Token**

### Step 2: Share Pages with Integration

1. Open a Notion page you want Wovly to access
2. Click **Share** in the top right
3. Click **Invite**
4. Select your "Wovly" integration

<Note>
  You must explicitly share pages/databases with the integration. It can only access pages you've shared.
</Note>

### Step 3: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on Notion
3. Paste your Integration Token
4. Click **Connect**

## Usage

```
"Search Notion for project notes"

"Create a new page in my Tasks database"

"What's in my meeting notes page?"

"Add a task to my Notion todo list"
```

## Sharing Access

The integration only sees pages you explicitly share:

1. **Database access** - Share the database to add/read items
2. **Page access** - Share individual pages to read/edit them
3. **Workspace access** - Share parent pages to access children

## How It Works

Wovly uses Notion's API with your integration token. The token doesn't expire but can be revoked anytime.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Page not found">
    Ensure the page is shared with your Wovly integration. Check Share settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't create page">
    You need to share the parent page or database with the integration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    The integration may have been removed from the page. Re-share it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
