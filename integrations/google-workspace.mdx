# Google Workspace

Connect Google Workspace to read and send emails via Gmail and manage your calendar.

## Capabilities

- **Read emails** - Search and read your inbox
- **Send emails** - Compose and send emails as yourself
- **Calendar** - View events, create meetings, check availability
- **Contacts** - Look up contacts for email addresses

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You need a Google Cloud project with OAuth credentials. This is required because Wovly needs to act as you (not a bot).

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable these APIs:
   - Gmail API
   - Google Calendar API

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
2. Select **External** user type
3. Fill in app information:
   - App name: "Wovly" (or your preference)
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact: Your email
4. Add scopes:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
5. Add your email as a test user

### Step 3: Create OAuth Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**
3. Select **Desktop app**
4. Name it "Wovly Desktop"
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 4: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on Google Workspace
3. Paste your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Click **Connect**
5. Sign in with your Google account
6. Authorize the requested permissions

## Usage

### Email

```
"Show my unread emails"

"Email jeff@example.com about the meeting"

"Search emails from Sarah last week"

"Reply to the email from John"
```

### Calendar

```
"What's on my calendar today?"

"Schedule a meeting with Jeff tomorrow at 2pm"

"When am I free this week?"

"Create an event for Friday at 3pm called Team Sync"
```

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why Needed |
|------------|------------|
| `gmail.modify` | Read and send emails |
| `calendar.events` | View and create calendar events |

<Note>
  Wovly requests the minimum permissions needed. Your emails and calendar data are only accessed when you ask Wovly to do something with them.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth error: App not verified">
    For personal use, this is fine - click "Advanced" then "Go to [App Name]". For production, you'd need to verify the app with Google.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token expired">
    Wovly automatically refreshes tokens. If it fails, disconnect and reconnect the integration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find emails">
    Gmail API returns recent emails by default. Use specific search terms: "emails from sarah" or "emails about budget"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Revoking Access

1. In Wovly: Click **Disconnect** on Google Workspace
2. In Google: Go to [Google Security](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and remove Wovly
