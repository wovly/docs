# Browser Automation

Browser automation lets Wovly browse the web, fill forms, and extract information for you.

## Capabilities

- **Navigate** - Open and browse websites
- **Click** - Interact with page elements
- **Type** - Fill in forms and search boxes
- **Extract** - Read content from pages
- **Screenshot** - Capture page visuals
- **Login** - Use saved credentials securely

## Requirements

- **Chrome or Chromium** - Must be installed
- **Browser enabled** - Toggle in Settings

## Setup

1. Ensure Chrome or Chromium is installed
2. Go to **Settings** in Wovly
3. Enable **Browser Automation**

## Usage

```
"Find flights from NYC to London in March"

"Search Amazon for wireless headphones under $100"

"What's the weather in Tokyo?"

"Fill out the contact form on example.com"
```

## How It Works

Wovly uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to control a browser instance:

1. Opens a Chrome window (you can watch it navigate)
2. Takes actions (click, type, scroll)
3. Captures screenshots for context
4. Reports findings back to you

## Credential Security

For websites requiring login:

1. Save credentials in the **Credentials** page first
2. Wovly auto-fills using secure placeholders
3. Actual passwords never appear in chat or logs

```
You: Log into my bank and check my balance

Wovly: [Uses saved credentials for bank.com]
       [Fills login form securely]
       Your current balance is $X,XXX.XX
```

<Warning>
  Never share passwords in chat. Use the Credentials page to store logins securely.
</Warning>

## Browser Tools

| Tool | Action |
|------|--------|
| `browser_navigate` | Open a URL |
| `browser_click` | Click an element |
| `browser_type` | Type text into a field |
| `browser_scroll` | Scroll the page |
| `browser_snapshot` | Capture current state |
| `browser_back` | Go to previous page |

## Tips

<Tip>
  **Be specific** - "Find flights on Google Flights" works better than "find flights"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Watch the browser** - You can see what Wovly is doing in the Chrome window
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use for research** - Great for price comparisons, finding information, filling forms
</Tip>
