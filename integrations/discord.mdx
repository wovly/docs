# Discord

Connect Discord to send messages to servers and direct messages.

## Capabilities

- **Send messages** - Post to channels and DMs
- **List servers** - View your Discord servers
- **List channels** - View channels in a server

## Setup

### Step 1: Create Discord Application

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**
3. Name it "Wovly"
4. Go to **OAuth2** section

### Step 2: Configure OAuth

1. Add Redirect URL: `http://localhost:18923/oauth/callback`
2. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 3: Set Scopes

Required OAuth2 scopes:
- `identify` - Get user info
- `guilds` - List servers
- `messages.read` - Read messages
- `gdm.join` - Join group DMs

### Step 4: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on Discord
3. Enter Client ID and Client Secret
4. Click **Connect**
5. Authorize in Discord

## Usage

```
"Send a message to #general in my Discord server"

"DM John on Discord about the game tonight"

"What Discord servers am I in?"

"Post to the announcements channel"
```

## How It Works

Wovly uses OAuth2 with user tokens, so messages appear as sent by you (not a bot).

## Permissions

| Permission | Why Needed |
|------------|------------|
| `identify` | Verify your Discord account |
| `guilds` | List your servers |
| `messages.read` | Read channel history |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't send to channel">
    You must have permission to send messages in that channel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Server not found">
    Ensure you're a member of the server. Wovly can only access servers you've joined.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OAuth error">
    Verify the redirect URL matches exactly: `http://localhost:18923/oauth/callback`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
