# GitHub

Connect GitHub to manage your repositories, issues, and pull requests.

## Capabilities

- **Read issues** - See open issues and PRs
- **Create issues** - Open new issues
- **Search code** - Find code across repos

## Setup

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Name it "Wovly"
4. Select scopes:
   - `repo` - Full repository access
   - `read:user` - Read user profile

### Step 2: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on GitHub
3. Paste your Personal Access Token
4. Click **Connect**

## Usage

```
"List my GitHub repositories"

"What are the open issues in my-repo?"

"Create an issue in my-repo: Bug in login page"

"Show recent pull requests"
```

## Permissions

| Scope | Why Needed |
|-------|------------|
| `repo` | Access public and private repositories |
| `read:user` | Get your GitHub profile |

<Note>
  The `repo` scope gives full access to your repositories. Use a fine-grained token if you want more control.
</Note>

## Fine-Grained Tokens

For more security, use a fine-grained personal access token:

1. Go to **Fine-grained tokens** in GitHub settings
2. Select specific repositories
3. Grant only needed permissions:
   - Issues: Read and write
   - Pull requests: Read
   - Contents: Read

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository not found">
    Ensure the token has access to the repository. Private repos need the `repo` scope.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    Check token scopes. You may need to regenerate with additional permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token expired">
    Personal access tokens can be set to expire. Generate a new one if expired.
  </Accordion>
