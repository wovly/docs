# Asana

Connect Asana to manage your tasks and projects.

## Capabilities

- **Create tasks** - Add new tasks to projects
- **Update tasks** - Mark complete, change due dates
- **List projects** - View your projects and workspaces

## Setup

### Step 1: Create Asana App

1. Go to [Asana Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/developer-console)
2. Click **Create new app**
3. Name it "Wovly"
4. Add Redirect URL: `http://localhost:18923/oauth/callback`
5. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on Asana

## Usage

```
"What are my Asana tasks?"

"Create a task in Project X: Review proposal"

"Mark the design review task as complete"

"What's due this week in Asana?"
```

## How It Works

Wovly uses OAuth 2.0 to access your Asana account. Tokens are refreshed automatically.

## Workspaces

If you have multiple Asana workspaces:

```
You: Create a task: Update documentation

Wovly: Which workspace should I create this in?
- Personal Tasks
- Company Workspace
```
