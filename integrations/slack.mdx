# Slack

Connect Slack to send messages as yourself, read channel history, and search conversations.

## Capabilities

- **Send DMs** - Message any user in your workspace
- **Post to channels** - Send messages to channels you're in
- **Read history** - View recent messages in conversations
- **Search users** - Find users by name or email

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You need to create a Slack app with user OAuth tokens. This lets Wovly act as you (not a bot).

### Step 1: Create Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App**
3. Select **From scratch**
4. Name it "Wovly" and select your workspace

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Scopes

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** in your app settings
2. Under **User Token Scopes**, add:
   - `channels:history` - Read channel messages
   - `channels:read` - List channels
   - `chat:write` - Send messages
   - `im:history` - Read DM history
   - `im:read` - List DMs
   - `im:write` - Open DM channels
   - `users:read` - List users
   - `users:read.email` - Find users by email

### Step 3: Set Redirect URL

1. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, find **Redirect URLs**
2. Add: `http://localhost:18924/oauth/callback`
3. Save

### Step 4: Get Credentials

1. Go to **Basic Information**
2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 5: Connect in Wovly

1. Go to **Integrations** in Wovly
2. Click **Setup** on Slack
3. Paste your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Click **Connect**
5. Authorize in Slack

## Usage

```
"Message Jeff in Slack about the deployment"

"Post to #general that the meeting is cancelled"

"What did Sarah say in Slack today?"

"Search Slack for messages about the API"
```

## How It Works

Wovly uses **user tokens** (not bot tokens), which means:

- Messages appear as sent by you, not a bot
- You can access your DMs and private channels
- Actions are indistinguishable from you using Slack directly

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why Needed |
|------------|------------|
| `channels:history` | Read public channel messages |
| `chat:write` | Send messages |
| `im:history` | Read DM conversations |
| `users:read` | Find users to message |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't post to channel">
    You must be a member of the channel. Wovly can only post to channels you've joined.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User not found">
    Check the user's display name or try their email address. Wovly searches both.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OAuth redirect error">
    Ensure `http://localhost:18924/oauth/callback` is in your Slack app's redirect URLs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Revoking Access

1. In Wovly: Click **Disconnect** on Slack
2. In Slack: Go to [Slack App Management](https://slack.com/apps/manage) and remove the app
