## Step 2: Configure LLM Provider

Wovly needs an LLM (Large Language Model) to power its AI capabilities. Choose one:

1. Open Wovly and go to **Settings**
2. Enter your API key for one of:
   - **Anthropic Claude** (recommended) - Get key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - **OpenAI GPT** - Get key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
   - **Google Gemini** - Get key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

<Tip>
  Claude Sonnet is recommended for the best balance of capability and speed.
