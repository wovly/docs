## What Makes Wovly Different

### Privacy-First Architecture

All your data stays on your machine. Wovly stores integration tokens locally and makes API calls directly from your computer - nothing passes through external servers.

### Autonomous Execution

Create **Tasks** that run in the background - scheduling meetings, following up on emails, coordinating with multiple people - all without constant supervision.

### Voice Mimicry

Wovly learns your communication style for each recipient. When drafting messages, it matches your tone, formality, and patterns so responses sound authentically like you.

### Multi-Platform Support

Connect to:
- **Email**: Gmail via Google Workspace
- **Chat**: Slack, Discord, Telegram
- **Messaging**: iMessage/SMS, WhatsApp
- **Social**: X (Twitter), Reddit
- **Productivity**: Notion, GitHub, Asana, Spotify
- **Web**: Full browser automation for research
