# Security

Wovly is designed with privacy and security as core principles.

## Privacy-First Architecture

### Local Data Storage

All your data stays on your machine:

```
~/.wovly-assistant/
├── settings.json      # Encrypted tokens and config
├── skills/            # Your custom skills
├── memory/            # Conversation history
└── tasks/             # Task data
```

Nothing is synced to cloud servers.

### No Wovly Servers

Wovly doesn't operate servers that process your data:

```
Your Machine ─────────► Google/Slack/OpenAI
             ◄─────────

(No Wovly servers in between)
```

## Encryption

### Token Storage

Integration tokens are encrypted using your operating system's secure storage:

| Platform | Encryption Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| macOS | Keychain |
| Windows | DPAPI |
| Linux | Secret Service |

### Credentials

Website credentials are doubly protected:
1. Encrypted at rest using OS keychain
2. Never sent to LLM providers
3. Never logged or displayed in chat

## LLM Privacy

### What LLMs See

When you chat with Wovly, your messages are sent to your chosen LLM provider:

- **Anthropic** (Claude) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- **OpenAI** (GPT) - [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
- **Google** (Gemini) - [Privacy Policy](https://ai.google.dev/terms)

### What LLMs Don't See

- Your saved credentials/passwords (never sent)
- Raw integration tokens (only used locally)
- Files on your computer (unless you share them)

### Conversation Context

The LLM receives:
- Your current message
- Recent conversation history (for context)
- Tool results (when tools are called)
- System instructions

## Integration Security

### OAuth Tokens

- Stored encrypted locally
- Auto-refreshed when expired
- Revocable anytime from the service provider

### Minimal Permissions

Each integration requests only necessary permissions:

| Integration | Permissions |
|-------------|------------|
| Google | gmail.modify, calendar.events |
| Slack | User scopes only (not bot) |
| GitHub | repo (or fine-grained) |

### Token Revocation

To fully disconnect an integration:
1. Disconnect in Wovly
2. Revoke in the service's settings (Google, Slack, etc.)

## Credential Security

### Secure Input

Wovly never asks for passwords in chat:

```
❌ User: "my password is hunter2"
✓ User: (saves in Credentials page)
```

If you try to share a password in chat, Wovly will stop you.

### Secure Usage

During browser automation:
1. Credentials are retrieved from encrypted storage
2. Filled directly into forms (not through LLM)
3. Never appear in chat, logs, or responses

## Best Practices

### API Keys

<Tip>
  Use environment-specific API keys when possible. If a key is compromised, rotate only that key.
</Tip>

### Credentials

<Tip>
  Use app-specific passwords for services that support them (Google, Apple, etc.).
</Tip>

### Integrations

<Tip>
  Periodically review connected integrations and revoke any you no longer use.
</Tip>

### Data Cleanup

<Tip>
  Clear conversation history periodically if it contains sensitive information:
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.wovly-assistant/memory/
  ```
</Tip>

## Threat Model

### Protected Against

- Remote data access (data stays local)
- Credential leakage to LLMs
- Token theft (encrypted storage)
- Man-in-the-middle (HTTPS for all APIs)

### Not Protected Against

- Local machine compromise (if someone has your machine)
- Malicious LLM provider (trust your provider)
- Social engineering (always verify before approving messages)

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a security issue:

1. **Do not** post publicly
2. Email security concerns to the project maintainers
3. Provide details to help reproduce

## Audit Trail

Wovly logs actions for your reference:

- Task execution logs
- Message send history
- Integration connection/disconnection

Logs are stored locally in `~/.wovly-assistant/` and can be deleted anytime.
