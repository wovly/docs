# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for Wovly.

## Installation Issues

### macOS: "App is damaged"

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Wovly.app
```

### macOS: "Cannot be opened because Apple cannot check"

Right-click the app → Open → Click "Open" in the dialog.

### Linux: AppImage won't run

```bash
chmod +x Wovly-x.x.x.AppImage
```

## LLM Issues

### "No API key configured"

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Enter your API key for Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google
3. Save and retry

### Slow responses

- Check your internet connection
- Try a different/faster model
- Reduce conversation history length

### "Rate limit exceeded"

Wait a few minutes and retry. Consider upgrading your API tier for higher limits.

## Integration Issues

### Google: OAuth error

1. Ensure OAuth consent screen is configured
2. Add your email as a test user
3. Check redirect URI: `http://localhost:18923/oauth/callback`

### Slack: "Missing scope"

1. Go to your Slack app settings
2. Add all required User Token Scopes
3. Reinstall the app to your workspace
4. Reconnect in Wovly

### iMessage: Can't read messages

1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy
2. Full Disk Access → Add Wovly
3. Restart Wovly

### Integration shows "Connected" but doesn't work

1. Click **Disconnect**
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Click **Connect** again
4. Re-authorize all permissions

## Task Issues

### Task stuck on "Waiting"

The task is waiting for an external reply. Check:
- Was the message actually sent?
- Has the recipient replied?
- Try: "Check for replies to the [task name] task"

### Task using wrong messaging channel

Wovly detects the channel from your request. Be explicit:
- "In Slack, message Jeff..."
- "Text Sarah..." (for iMessage)
- "Email John..."

### Task not progressing

Check the task log for errors. Common causes:
- Integration disconnected
- Rate limits hit
- Approval needed (check Tasks panel)

## Browser Automation Issues

### Browser not opening

1. Install Chrome or Chromium
2. Enable browser automation in Settings
3. Restart Wovly

### Page not loading

Some sites block automation. Try:
- Using a different approach
- Checking if the site requires login

### Can't click element

1. Ask Wovly to scroll first
2. The element may be in an iframe (not supported)
3. Try a different selector

### Login failing

1. Check credentials in Credentials page
2. Ensure domain matches exactly
3. Handle 2FA manually if prompted

## Memory Issues

### Wovly doesn't remember

1. Memory is session-based by default
2. Check if memory files exist in `~/.wovly-assistant/memory/`
3. Try explicit recall: "Do you remember when we discussed..."

### Wrong context used

Be specific in your request. Reference the conversation explicitly.

## Performance Issues

### High CPU usage

- Close other applications
- Check for infinite task loops
- Restart Wovly

### High memory usage

- Clear conversation history
- Restart Wovly periodically
- Delete old task files

## Data Issues

### Reset all settings

```bash
rm -rf ~/.wovly-assistant/
```

<Warning>
  This deletes all data including integrations, skills, memory, and tasks.
</Warning>

### Export data

Copy the entire `~/.wovly-assistant/` folder to back up.

### Corrupt settings file

```bash
rm ~/.wovly-assistant/settings.json
```

Then restart Wovly and reconfigure.
